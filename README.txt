- This is written in python for Windows 64bit. Ensure that you at least
have a Windows 7 or higher installation.

- A web browser is required to interact with the app as it is a local 
service serving HTML content.

- There is no front-end javascript involved so strict browser security 
will not prevent any functionality. 

- Administrator permissions might be necessary for the initial install
when running the installer.sh

- The full Python exe is included for offline installation.
